            - Extended Expression allows additional higher level context to be

              rule for IDFW feature.  Current version only support a single
              IdentityGroupExpression. In the future, this might expand to
              support other conjunction and non-conjunction expression.
            - The extended expression list must follow below criteria
                - 1. Contains a single IdentityGroupExpression. No conjunction
                  expression is supported
                - 2. No other non-conjunction expression is supported, except
                  for IdentityGroupExpression
                - 3. Each expression must be a valid Expression. See the
                  definition of the Expression type for more information
                - 4. Extended expression are implicitly AND with expression
                - 5. No nesting can be supported if this value is used
                - 6. If a Group is using extended expression, this group must
