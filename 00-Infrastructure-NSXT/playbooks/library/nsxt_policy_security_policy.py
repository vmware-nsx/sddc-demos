            - A way to classify a security policy, if needed.
            - Distributed Firewall
                - Policy framework provides five pre-defined categories for
                classifying a security policy. They are "Ethernet",Emergency",
                "Infrastructure", "Environment" and "Application". There is a
                pre-determined order in which the policy framework manages the
                priority of these security policies. Ethernet category is for
                supporting layer 2 firewall rules. The other four categories
                are applicable for layer 3 rules. Amongst them, the Emergency
                category has the highest priority followed by Infrastructure,
                Environment and then Application rules. Administrator can
                choose to categorize a security policy into the above
                categories or can choose to leave it empty. If empty it will
                have the least precedence w.r.t the above four categories.
            - Edge Firewall
                - Policy Framework for Edge Firewall provides six pre-defined
                categories "Emergency", "SystemRules", "SharedPreRules",
                "LocalGatewayRules", "AutoServiceRules" and
                "Default", in order of priority of rules.
                All categories are allowed for Gatetway Policies
                that belong to 'default' Domain. However, for
                user created domains, category is restricted to
                "SharedPreRules" or "LocalGatewayRules" only.
                Also, the users can add/modify/delete rules from
                only the "SharedPreRules" and "LocalGatewayRules"
                categories. If user doesn't specify the category
                then defaulted to "Rules". System generated
                category is used by NSX created rules, for
                example BFD rules. Autoplumbed category used by
                NSX verticals to autoplumb data path rules.
                Finally, "Default" category is the placeholder
                default rules with lowest in the order of priority.

            - Connectivity strategy applicable for this SecurityPolicy
            - This field indicates the default connectivity policy for the
              security policy. Based on the connectivitiy strategy, a default
              rule for this security policy will be created. An appropriate
              action will be set on the rule based on the value of the
              connectivity strategy. If NONE is selected or no connectivity
              strategy is specified, then no default rule for the security
              policy gets created. The default rule that gets created will be a
              any-any rule and applied to entities specified in the scope of
              the security policy. Specifying the connectivity_strategy without
              specifying the scope is not allowed. The scope has to be a
              Group and one cannot specify IPAddress directly in the group that
              is used as scope. This default rule is only applicable for the
              Layer3 security policies
            - WHITELIST - Adds a default drop rule. Administrator can then use
              "allow" rules (aka whitelist) to allow traffic between groups
            - BLACKLIST - Adds a default allow rule. Admin can then use "drop"
              rules (aka blacklist) to block traffic between groups
            - WHITELIST_ENABLE_LOGGING - Whitelising with logging enabled
            - BLACKLIST_ENABLE_LOGGING - Blacklisting with logging enabled
            - NONE - No default rule is created
    locked:
        type: bool
        description:
            - Lock a security policy
            - Indicates whether a security policy should be locked. If the
              security policy is locked by a user, then no other user would
              be able to modify this security policy. Once the user releases
              the lock, other users can update this security policy.

              on all rules in this security policy. When it is stateful, the
              state of the network connects are tracked and a stateful packet
              inspection is performed.
            - Layer3 security policies can be stateful or stateless.
              By default, they are stateful.
            - Layer2 security policies can only be stateless.
